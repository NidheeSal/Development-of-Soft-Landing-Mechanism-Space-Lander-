# LoRa-Based ESP32 Transceiver with OLED Display & Web Server
This project implements a LoRa-based data receiver using an ESP32. It collects sensor data from a LoRa transmitter, displays it on an OLED screen, and makes the data accessible via a Wi-Fi web server. The received data includes distance (mm), acceleration (m/sÂ²), gyration (rad/s), and signal strength (RSSI). The project also integrates NTP (Network Time Protocol) to timestamp received data.
